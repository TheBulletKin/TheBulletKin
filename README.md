# About Me
Oliver Warry | Student at University of Plymouth | Games Designer / Programmer | <Website link>

## Description
I am a games designer / programmer working on several projects demonstrating skills in Unity, Java, C++ and OpenGL. 

A massive fan of stealth games, shooters and exploration games akin to Stalker, Dishonored and Rainbow Six. I want to create games and projects that let players express creative intent through mastery of mechanics and a desire to experiment within the game space.

I am currently working on my [long term personal personal game](https://github.com/TheBulletKin/3000-Game), a tactical shooter, stealth game hybrid with a bit of dark mysticism. It aims to combine the tactical feel of early Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six with the sandbox and creative elements of Dishonored. 

As well as a <public blog page> where I make posts discussion game design theory and developments on various projects.

# Projects
## Stalker OpenGL Scene
My [Stalker scene recreation](https://github.com/TheBulletKin/Atmospheric-Anomalous-Forest-Scene) was made using OpenGL and C++. More details are present on the attached readme. It features dynamic lighting, instanced tree rendering, coloured lighting and surface displacement in the vertex shader.

## Stylised environmental landscape
Created using OpenGL and C++, my [stylised environment](https://github.com/TheBulletKin/3015-Project1) showcases normal based texture mapping, particle systems, dynamic lighting, distance fog and cloud shadows through texture blending.

## Console based rhythm game
I developed a [console window based rhythm game](https://github.com/TheBulletKin/Console-Rhythm-Game) using C++. Documentation listed in the readme. Single key input lets you record a beat track, can then play the track by pressing keys to the beat.

## Third person shadow stealth game
This [shadow based stealth game](https://github.com/TheBulletKin/2007-Coursework-Assignment) is a short demo with AI controlled enemies with various awareness states, weapon systems and a stealth system that alters your visibility to enemies based on light exposure.

## Guard Duty
A [multiplayer Thief-like](https://github.com/TheBulletKin/Guard-Duty) where a team of thieves play against a team of guards, in a game of brain over brawn.
